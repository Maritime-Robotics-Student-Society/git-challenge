# Git challenge

Welcome the to Git challenge!

Git is a *version control system*. We use it to share files and track how they
change. It's especially useful for code, but it works for other files too.

For this challenge, you need to get a copy of this *repository* onto your own
computer, add your names to the README file, and push your changes back.

First, you'll need to install Git. For Windows or Mac, go to
https://git-scm.com/downloads for a download. For Linux, you can install it with
your package manager (e.g. `apt` or `dnf`). If you're borrowing a team laptop,
it probably already has git installed.

You'll also need a free Github account. Sign up at https://github.com/, and tell
us your username so we can give you access to this repository.

To get a copy of this repository, run:

    git clone https://github.com/Maritime-Robotics-Student-Society/git-challenge.git

This will create a new folder called `git-challenge`. Open it up, and open
`README.md` in a text editor. If you don't already have a decent text editor handy,
try [Atom](https://atom.io/). There's a lot of different text editors, and
programmers get very excited about them.

Add your team at the end of the file.

Now it's time to send your change to Github. Get a prompt inside the
`git-challenge` directory.

    # Tell git which file we've changed
    git add README.md
    
    # Record the changes. This will ask for a 'commit message' describing the change.
    git commit
    
    # Send the changes to Github. You'll need your Github username and password.
    git push
